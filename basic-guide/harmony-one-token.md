# Harmony ONE token

In 2014, Buterin proposed a new blockchain infrastructure called Ethereum, which enabled developers to create various kinds of blockchain applications using “smart contracts.” However, Ethereum didn’t solve the scalability problem and, with its \~15 TPS, failed to support high-throughput applications such as gaming or decentralized exchanges.

&#x20;Given Ethereum and Bitcoin’s performance limitations, many blockchain projects proposed various solutions that attempt to increase transaction throughput. (Transforming from P-o-W to P-o-S) EOS, IOATA and Zilliqa introduced. However, these proposed solution cannot make significant performance gains without sacrificing other critical aspects, such as security and decentralization.&#x20;

Harmony introduced, the next generation sharding-based blockchain that is fully scalable, provably secure, and energy efficient. Harmony addresses the problems of existing blockchains by combining the best research results and engineering practice in an optimally tuned system. Specifically, Harmony makes breakthroughs in following aspects:

&#x20;• Fully Scalable: Harmony shards not only the network communication and transaction validation like Zilliqa, but also shards the blockchain state. This makes Harmony a fully scalable blockchain.

&#x20;• Secure Sharding: Harmony’s sharding process is provably secure thanks to the distributed randomness generation (DRG) process which is unpredictable, unbiaseable, verifiable and scalable. Harmony also reshards the network in a non-interruptive manner to prevent against slowly adaptive byzantine adversaries.

&#x20;• Efficient and Fast Consensus: Unlike other sharding-based blockchains which require PoW to select validators, Harmony is based on PoS and thus energy efficient. Consensus is reached with a linearly scalable BFT algorithm that’s 100 times faster than PBFT.&#x20;

• Adaptive-Thresholded PoS: The threshold of stakes required for a node to join the network is adjusted based on the volume of total staking in a way that malicious stakers cannot concentrate their power in a single shard. Moreover, the threshold is low enough so that small stakers can still participate in the network and earn rewards.&#x20;

• Scalable Networking Infrastructure: With RaptorQ fountain code, Harmony can propagate blocks quickly within shards or across network by using the Adaptive Information Dispersal Algorithm. Harmony also adopts Kademlia routing to achieve cross-shard transactions that scale logarithmically with the number of shards.&#x20;

• Consistent Cross-Shard Transactions: Harmony supports cross-shard transactions with shards directly communicating with each other. An atomic locking mechanism is used to ensure the consistency of crossshard transactions. By innovating on both the protocol and network layers, Harmony provides the world with a scalable and secure blockchain system that is able to support the emerging decentralized economy. Harmony will enable applications which were not previously feasible on blockchain, including high-volume decentralized exchanges, interactive fair games, Visa-scale payment systems, and Internet-of-Things transactions. Harmony strives to scale trust for billions of people and create a radically fair economy.
