# VoldemArt Marketplace & Harmony Protocol

The VoldemArt is a NFT marketplace that supports the creation, buying and selling of NFTs \(Non - fungible tokens\) minted on [Harmony](http://harmony/) blockchain. That means [ONE](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/harmony), the Harmony native token, fuels all transactions on VoldemArt¬¥s platform, in contrast to Rarible or OpenSea that use ETH.

### **Benefits of Harmony ONE vs. ETH based platforms.** <a id="benefits-of-harmony-one-vs-eth-based-platforms"></a>

* NFTs minted on Harmony _**cost less than 0.01$ - 0.001ONE**_ _,_ with [EPoS](https://medium.com/harmony-one/introducing-harmonys-effective-proof-of-stake-epos-2d39b4b8d58#:~:text=The%20effective%20stake%20of%20a,by%20the%20validator%27s%20effective%20stake.) \(Effective Proof-of-Stake\) consensus algorithm, **requiring 99% less energy use than PoW**. Ethereum case is the opposite, 50-100$ approx. for a transaction with PoW \(Proof-of-Work\) consensus algorithm, which required a lot of computational power. **Climate activists have RED FLAGGED ETH üö©**, specifically, in order to power the data centers that sustain the blockchain they are spending a lot of energy. In VoldemArt, the entrance barrier for newcomers is much lower, giving every single person the NFTs creation possibility, and we can call it **‚ÄúGreen‚Äù** ‚ôªÔ∏è for the environment.
* On the Harmony blockchain each block is signed each [2 sec. time](https://medium.com/harmony-one/2-seconds-block-time-on-harmony-mainnet-aba78ee5643f), so the transaction in VoldemArt¬¥s platform as a user experience is like using a VISA.
* Comparison between Harmony and other crypto blockchains.
