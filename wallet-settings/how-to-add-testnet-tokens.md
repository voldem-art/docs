# How To Add Testnet Tokens

Hey Voldie!

First you should add Harmony Testnet network on your wallet.&#x20;

the settings of that is written [**HERE**](https://docs.voldem.art/voldemart/wallet-settings/metamask/setting-up)****

After that, change your network to the Harmony Testnet and then go to** **[**THIS**](https://faucet.pops.one) webpage!

You must enter your ONE address in Harmony ONE style if it is on ETH style (for metamask users)

Use** **[**Harmony Explorer **](https://explorer.harmony.one)to access to your ONE style address for getting tokens.

Daily limit for getting testnet tokens are 1000 $ONE.
